##Getting started

#Connecting to a power source

In order to use the terminal you have to connect it to some power source.
For ease of use, we have provided a battery that you can to connect using the pins on the front of the battery/chassis to the back of the terminal.

You can use a USB-C to power either the terminal directly or to charge the battery. To turn the battery on, hold down the black button on the bottom of the battery.

#Connecting the sensors

Once you're connected the battery/chassis you can now plug in the sensors.

The "Grove Ultrasonic Ranger" (two tubular metal pieces) is responsible for detecting motions. It should be connected to the port opposite to the three-way power on button (on the battery/chassis).

The "Grove RGB Chainable LED" should be connected directly below the power on button. Make sure you plug it in to the "in" part of the LED.
